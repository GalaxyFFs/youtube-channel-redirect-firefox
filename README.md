## 🎯 What it does

When you visit a YouTube channel like `youtube.com/@channelname`, this extension automatically redirects you to `youtube.com/@channelname/videos` so you can see their content immediately without clicking the Videos tab.

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic redirects** - Saves you a click on every channel visit
- **Toggle on/off** - Easy enable/disable via extension popup
- **Smart detection** - Works with both direct navigation and YouTube's SPA
- **Lightweight** - Minimal performance impact
- **Privacy-focused** - No data collection, no tracking, no external requests
- **Open source** - Full transparency, review the code yourself

## 📦 Installation

### From GitHub Releases
1. Download the latest `.xpi` file from [Releases](https://github.com/GalaxyFFs/youtube-channel-redirect-firefox/releases)
2. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:addons`
3. Click the gear icon ⚙️ → "Install Add-on From File..."
4. Select the downloaded `.xpi` file

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GalaxyFFs/youtube-channel-redirect-firefox.git
cd youtube-channel-redirect-firefox
```

Then in Firefox:
1. Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
3. Select any file in the extension directory (e.g., `manifest.json`)

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Install the extension** (see above)
2. **Visit any YouTube channel** - The redirect happens automatically!
3. **Toggle on/off** - Click the extension icon in your toolbar to enable/disable

That's it! The extension works silently in the background.

## 🔧 How it works

The extension uses two methods to catch navigation:

1. **Full page loads** - Intercepts via `webNavigation.onCommitted` API
2. **YouTube SPA navigation** - Listens to YouTube's `yt-navigate-finish` events and History API changes

When it detects you're on a channel root page (`/@channelname`), it safely redirects to `/@channelname/videos`.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- ✅ **No data collection** - We don't collect, store, or transmit any data
- ✅ **No tracking** - No analytics, no telemetry
- ✅ **No external requests** - All processing happens locally
- ✅ **Minimal permissions** - Only requests what's necessary:
  - `storage` - To remember your enable/disable preference
  - `webNavigation` - To detect when you visit a channel
  - `tabs` - To perform the redirect
  - `https://www.youtube.com/*` - Only works on YouTube
